This project uses a Mock Google Map View to allow user to create two POI. With the two POIs, the mobile app will caculate the distance and bearing using the Google Map Api. The goal of this project is trying combining the bearing from the Google Map Api and the compass bearing from the watch (obtained using the built-in sensors)
